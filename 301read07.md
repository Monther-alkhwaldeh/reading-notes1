# /businesses/search

This endpoint returns up to 1000 businesses based on the provided search criteria. It has some basic information about the business. To get detailed information and reviews, please use the Business ID returned here and refer to /businesses/{id} and /businesses/{id}/reviews endpoints.

Note: at this time, the API does not return businesses without any reviews.

Request
GET <https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search>
Parameters
These parameters should be in the query string.

Name Type Description
term string Optional. Search term, for example "food" or "restaurants". The term may also be business names, such as "Starbucks". If term is not included the endpoint will default to searching across businesses from a small number of popular categories.
location string Required if either latitude or longitude is not provided. This string indicates the geographic area to be used when searching for businesses. Examples: "New York City", "NYC", "350 5th Ave, New York, NY 10118". Businesses returned in the response may not be strictly within the specified location.
latitude decimal Required if location is not provided. Latitude of the location you want to search nearby.
longitude decimal Required if location is not provided. Longitude of the location you want to search nearby.
radius int Optional. A suggested search radius in meters. This field is used as a suggestion to the search. The actual search radius may be lower than the suggested radius in dense urban areas, and higher in regions of less business density. If the specified value is too large, a AREA_TOO_LARGE error may be returned. The max value is 40000 meters (about 25 miles).
categories string Optional. Categories to filter the search results with. See the list of supported categories. The category filter can be a list of comma delimited categories. For example, "bars,french" will filter by Bars OR French. The category identifier should be used (for example "discgolf", not "Disc Golf").
locale string Optional. Specify the locale into which to localize the business information. See the list of supported locales. Defaults to en_US.
limit int Optional. Number of business results to return. By default, it will return 20. Maximum is 50.
offset int Optional. Offset the list of returned business results by this amount.
sort_by string Optional. Suggestion to the search algorithm that the results be sorted by one of the these modes: best_match, rating, review_count or distance. The default is best_match. Note that specifying the sort_by is a suggestion (not strictly enforced) to Yelp's search, which considers multiple input parameters to return the most relevant results. For example, the rating sort is not strictly sorted by the rating value, but by an adjusted rating value that takes into account the number of ratings, similar to a Bayesian average. This is to prevent skewing results to businesses with a single review.
price string Optional. Pricing levels to filter the search result with: 1 = $, 2 = $$, 3 = $$$, 4 = $$$$. The price filter can be a list of comma delimited pricing levels. For example, "1, 2, 3" will filter the results to show the ones that are $, $$, or $$$.
open_now boolean Optional. Default to false. When set to true, only return the businesses open now. Notice that open_at and open_now cannot be used together.
open_at int Optional. An integer represending the Unix time in the same timezone of the search location. If specified, it will return business open at the given time. Notice that open_at and open_now cannot be used together.
attributes string Optional. Try these additional filters to return specific search results!
hot_and_new - popular businesses which recently joined Yelp
request_a_quote - businesses which actively reply to Request a Quote inquiries
reservation - businesses with Yelp Reservations bookings enabled on their profile page
waitlist_reservation - businesses with Yelp Waitlist bookings enabled on their profile screen (iOS/Android)
deals - businesses offering Yelp Deals on their profile page
gender_neutral_restrooms - businesses which provide gender neutral restrooms
open_to_all - businesses which are Open To All
wheelchair_accessible - businesses which are Wheelchair Accessible
You can combine multiple attributes by providing a comma separated like "attribute1,attribute2". If multiple attributes are used, only businesses that satisfy ALL attributes will be returned in search results. For example, the attributes "hot_and_new,request_a_quote" will return businesses that are Hot and New AND offer Request a Quote.
Note
Using the offset and limit parameters, you can get up to 1000 businesses from this endpoint if there are more than 1000 results. If you request a page out of this 1000 business limit, this endpoint will return an error.

## SuperAgent
SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!

 request
   .post('/api/pet')
   .send({ name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' })
   .set('X-API-Key', 'foobar')
   .set('Accept', 'application/json')
   .then(res => {
      alert('yay got ' + JSON.stringify(res.body));
   });
Test documentation
The following test documentation was generated with Mocha's "doc" reporter, and directly reflects the test suite. This provides an additional source of documentation.

Request basics
A request can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the request object, then calling .then() (or .end() or await) to send the request. For example a simple GET request:

 request
   .get('/search')
   .then(res => {
      // res.body, res.headers, res.status
   })
   .catch(err => {
      // err.message, err.response
   });
HTTP method may also be passed as a string:

request('GET', '/search').then(success, failure);
Old-style callbacks are also supported, but not recommended. Instead of .then() you can call .end():

request('GET', '/search').end(function(err, res){
  if (res.ok) {}
});
Absolute URLs can be used. In web browsers absolute URLs work only if the server implements CORS.

 request
   .get('https://example.com/search')
   .then(res => {

   });
The Node client supports making requests to Unix Domain Sockets:

// pattern: https?+unix://SOCKET_PATH/REQUEST_PATH
//          Use `%2F` as `/` in SOCKET_PATH
try {
  const res = await request
    .get('http+unix://%2Fabsolute%2Fpath%2Fto%2Funix.sock/search');
  // res.body, res.headers, res.status
} catch(err) {
  // err.message, err.response
}
DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, POST, and PUT requests can also be used, simply change the method name:

request
  .head('/favicon.ico')
  .then(res => {

  });
DELETE can be also called as .del() for compatibility with old IE where delete is a reserved word.

The HTTP method defaults to GET, so if you wish, the following is valid:

 request('/search', (err, res) => {

 });
Setting header fields
Setting header fields is simple, invoke .set() with a field name and value:

 request
   .get('/search')
   .set('API-Key', 'foobar')
   .set('Accept', 'application/json')
   .then(callback);
You may also pass an object to set several fields in a single call:

 request
   .get('/search')
   .set({ 'API-Key': 'foobar', Accept: 'application/json' })
   .then(callback);
GET requests
The .query() method accepts objects, which when used with the GET method will form a query-string. The following will produce the path /search?query=Manny&range=1..5&order=desc.

 request
   .get('/search')
   .query({ query: 'Manny' })
   .query({ range: '1..5' })
   .query({ order: 'desc' })
   .then(res => {

   });
Or as a single object:

request
  .get('/search')
  .query({ query: 'Manny', range: '1..5', order: 'desc' })
  .then(res => {

  });
The .query() method accepts strings as well:

  request
    .get('/querystring')
    .query('search=Manny&range=1..5')
    .then(res => {

    });
Or joined:

  request
    .get('/querystring')
    .query('search=Manny')
    .query('range=1..5')
    .then(res => {

    });
HEAD requests
You can also use the .query() method for HEAD requests. The following will produce the path /users?email=joe@smith.com.

  request
    .head('/users')
    .query({ email: 'joe@smith.com' })
    .then(res => {

    });
POST / PUT requests
A typical JSON POST request might look a little like the following, where we set the Content-Type header field appropriately, and "write" some data, in this case just a JSON string.

  request.post('/user')
    .set('Content-Type', 'application/json')
    .send('{"name":"tj","pet":"tobi"}')
    .then(callback)
    .catch(errorCallback)
Since JSON is undoubtedly the most common, it's the default! The following example is equivalent to the previous.

  request.post('/user')
    .send({ name: 'tj', pet: 'tobi' })
    .then(callback, errorCallback)
Or using multiple .send() calls:

  request.post('/user')
    .send({ name: 'tj' })
    .send({ pet: 'tobi' })
    .then(callback, errorCallback)
By default sending strings will set the Content-Type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multiple calls will be concatenated with &, here resulting in name=tj&pet=tobi:

  request.post('/user')
    .send('name=tj')
    .send('pet=tobi')
    .then(callback, errorCallback);
SuperAgent formats are extensible, however by default "json" and "form" are supported. To send the data as application/x-www-form-urlencoded simply invoke .type() with "form", where the default is "json". This request will POST the body "name=tj&pet=tobi".

  request.post('/user')
    .type('form')
    .send({ name: 'tj' })
    .send({ pet: 'tobi' })
    .then(callback, errorCallback)
Sending a FormData object is also supported. The following example will POST the content of the HTML form identified by id="myForm":

  request.post('/user')
    .send(new FormData(document.getElementById('myForm')))
    .then(callback, errorCallback)
Setting the Content-Type
The obvious solution is to use the .set() method:

 request.post('/user')
   .set('Content-Type', 'application/json')
As a short-hand the .type() method is also available, accepting the canonicalized MIME type name complete with type/subtype, or simply the extension name such as "xml", "json", "png", etc:

 request.post('/user')
   .type('application/json')

 request.post('/user')
   .type('json')

 request.post('/user')
   .type('png')
Serializing request body
SuperAgent will automatically serialize JSON and forms. You can setup automatic serialization for other types as well:

request.serialize['application/xml'] = function (obj) {
    return 'string generated from obj';
};

// going forward, all requests with a Content-type of
// 'application/xml' will be automatically serialized
If you want to send the payload in a custom format, you can replace the built-in serialization with the .serialize() method on a per-request basis:

request
    .post('/user')
    .send({foo: 'bar'})
    .serialize(obj => {
        return 'string generated from obj';
    });
Retrying requests
When given the .retry() method, SuperAgent will automatically retry requests, if they fail in a way that is transient or could be due to a flaky Internet connection.

This method has two optional arguments: number of retries (default 1) and a callback. It calls callback(err, res) before each retry. The callback may return true/false to control whether the request should be retried (but the maximum number of retries is always applied).

 request
   .get('https://example.com/search')
   .retry(2) // or:
   .retry(2, callback)
   .then(finished);
   .catch(failed);
Use .retry() only with requests that are idempotent (i.e. multiple requests reaching the server won't cause undesirable side effects like duplicate purchases).

All request methods are tried by default (which means if you do not want POST requests to be retried, you will need to pass a custom retry callback).

By default the following status codes are retried:

408
413
429
500
502
503
504
521
522
524
By default the following error codes are retried:

'ETIMEDOUT'
'ECONNRESET'
'EADDRINUSE'
'ECONNREFUSED'
'EPIPE'
'ENOTFOUND'
'ENETUNREACH'
'EAI_AGAIN'
Setting Accept
In a similar fashion to the .type() method it is also possible to set the Accept header via the short hand method .accept(). Which references request.types as well allowing you to specify either the full canonicalized MIME type name as type/subtype, or the extension suffix form as "xml", "json", "png", etc. for convenience:

 request.get('/user')
   .accept('application/json')

 request.get('/user')
   .accept('json')

 request.post('/user')
   .accept('png')
Facebook and Accept JSON
If you are calling Facebook's API, be sure to send an Accept: application/json header in your request. If you don't do this, Facebook will respond with Content-Type: text/javascript; charset=UTF-8, which SuperAgent will not parse and thus res.body will be undefined. You can do this with either req.accept('json') or req.header('Accept', 'application/json'). See issue 1078 for details.

Query strings
req.query(obj) is a method which may be used to build up a query-string. For example populating ?format=json&dest=/login on a POST:

request
  .post('/')
  .query({ format: 'json' })
  .query({ dest: '/login' })
  .send({ post: 'data', here: 'wahoo' })
  .then(callback);
By default the query string is not assembled in any particular order. An asciibetically-sorted query string can be enabled with req.sortQuery(). You may also provide a custom sorting comparison function with req.sortQuery(myComparisonFn). The comparison function should take 2 arguments and return a negative/zero/positive integer.

 // default order
 request.get('/user')
   .query('name=Nick')
   .query('search=Manny')
   .sortQuery()
   .then(callback)

 // customized sort function
 request.get('/user')
   .query('name=Nick')
   .query('search=Manny')
   .sortQuery((a, b) => a.length - b.length)
   .then(callback)
TLS options
In Node.js SuperAgent supports methods to configure HTTPS requests:

.ca(): Set the CA certificate(s) to trust
.cert(): Set the client certificate chain(s)
.key(): Set the client private key(s)
.pfx(): Set the client PFX or PKCS12 encoded private key and certificate chain
.disableTLSCerts(): Does not reject expired or invalid TLS certs. Sets internally rejectUnauthorized=true. Be warned, this method allows MITM attacks.
For more information, see Node.js https.request docs.

var key = fs.readFileSync('key.pem'),
    cert = fs.readFileSync('cert.pem');

request
  .post('/client-auth')
  .key(key)
  .cert(cert)
  .then(callback);
var ca = fs.readFileSync('ca.cert.pem');

request
  .post('https://localhost/private-ca-server')
  .ca(ca)
  .then(res => {});
Parsing response bodies
SuperAgent will parse known response-body data for you, currently supporting application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/json, and multipart/form-data. You can setup automatic parsing for other response-body data as well:

//browser
request.parse['application/xml'] = function (str) {
    return {'object': 'parsed from str'};
};

//node
request.parse['application/xml'] = function (res, cb) {
    //parse response text and set res.body here

    cb(null, res);
};

//going forward, responses of type 'application/xml'
//will be parsed automatically
