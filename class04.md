## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

### A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

### A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

## The name of the function.

### A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.

### The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

## WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

### Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.


### How does pair programming work?
## While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

## Why pair program?
### While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful


1. Greater efficiency
It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making.

2. Engaged collaboration
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work. 

3. Learning from fellow students
Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.

4. Social skills
Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. 

5. Job interview readiness
A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen.

 ### Work environment readiness Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.

 ## Links

### Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
### You will commonly come across the following types of links:
### Links from one website to another
### Links from one page to another on the same website
 ### Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page
 ### Links that open in a new browser window
### Links that start up your email program and address a new
### email to someone

## Layout
### In this chapter we are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.
### This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be
### different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this chapter we will:
### Explore different ways to position elements using normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
### Discover how various devices have different screen sizes and resolution, and how this affects the design process. Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts, and how they are created.
### Find out how designers use grids to make their page designs look more professional.

### Key Concepts in Positioning El ements Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
### Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

## Containing Elements
### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
