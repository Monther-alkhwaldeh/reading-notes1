# jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed

## SELECT ELEMENTS

### It is simpler to access elements using jQuery's CSS-style selectors than it is using DOM queries. The selectors are also more powerful and flexible

## PERFORM TASKS

### jQuery's methods let you update the DOM tree, animate elements into and out of view, and loop through a set of elements, all in one line of code

## HANDLE EVENTS

### jQuery includes methods that allow you to attach event listeners to selected elements without having to write any tailback code to support older browsers

## WHY USE JQUERY?

### jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript

## It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a

### quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler

1: SIMPLE SELECTORS
As you saw in Chapter 5, which introduced the
DOM, it is not always easy to select the elements
that you want to. For example:
• Older browsers do not support the latest
methods for selecting elements.
• IE does not treat whitespace between elements
as text nodes, while other browsers do.
Such issues make it hard to select the right elements
on a page across all major browsers.
Rather than learn a new way to select elements,
jQuery uses a language that is already familiar to
front-end web developers: CSS selectors. They:
• Are much faster at selecting elements
• Can be a lot more accurate about which elements
to select
• Often require a lot less code than older DOM
methods
• Are already used by most front-end developers
jQuery even adds some extra CSS-style selectors
which offer additional functionality.
Since jQuery was created, modern browsers
have implemented the querySe 1 ector () and
querySe 1ectorA11 () methods to let developers
select elements using CSS syntax. However, these
methods are not supported in older browsers.

2: COMMON TASKS IN LESS CODE
There are some tasks that front-end developers
need to do regularly, such as loop through the
elements that have been selected.
jQuery has methods that offer web developers
simpler ways to perform common tasks, such as:
• loop through elements
• Add I remove elements from the DOM tree
• Handle events
• Fade elements into I out of view
• Handle Ajax requests
jQuery simplifies each of these tasks, and allows you
to write less code to achieve them.
jQuery also offers chaining of methods (a technique
which you will meet on p311). Once you have
selected· some elements, this allows you to apply
multiple methods to the same selection.
jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve
the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write
with plain JavaScript.
3: CROSS-BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
jQuery automatically handles the inconsistent ways
in which browsers select elements and handle
events, so you do not need to write cross-browser
fa llback code (such as that shown in the previous
two chapters).
To do this, jQuery uses feat ure detection to find
the best way to achieve a task. It involves the use
of many conditional statements: if the browser
supports the ideal way to achieve a task, it us.es that
approach; otherwise, it tests to see if it supports the
next best option to achieve the same task.
This was the technique used in the last chapter to
determine whether or not the browser supported
event listeners. If event listeners were not supported,
an alternative approach was offered (aimed at users
of Internet Explorer 8 and older versions of IE).

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character? You can, with pair programming, a technique common to many agile work environments.

More “two heads are better than one” than “stop reading over my shoulder,” pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills.
1 Greater efficiency
It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product). So, in the long-run, it’s often actually more efficient than two people working on separate features. When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own. Also, when the pair is stuck, both programmers can research the problem and reach a solution faster. Researches also identified pairing enhances technical skills, team communication, and even enjoyability of coding in the workplace.

2 Engaged collaboration
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work. Popping open your Facebook timeline is just that less enticing when someone else is looking at your screen.

Another important aspect of learning to program is knowing when to ask for help. We advise our students to spend no more than fifteen minutes stuck on a problem before asking a teaching assistant or instructor for help. When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help. Ultimately, this boosts overall confidence.

3 Learning from fellow students
Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.

Often times, the developers in a pairing have different skill sets. If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area. The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance, and the latter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding.

4 Social skills
Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself.

This has long-term career impacts. As much as employers want strong programmers, they know it’s essential to hire people who can work well with others.

5 Job interview readiness
A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base. By doing so, companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style.

For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.

6 Work environment readiness
Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
