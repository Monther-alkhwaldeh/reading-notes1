## Comparison Operators
### Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
## Logical Operators
### Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.


## The for Loop
### The for loop repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. It is typically used to execute a block of code for certain number of times. Its syntax is:

#### for(initialization; condition; increment) {
   #### // Code to be executed
#### }
### The parameters of the for loop statement have following meanings:

### initialization — it is used to initialize the counter variables, and evaluated once unconditionally before the first execution of the body of the loop.

### condition — it is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration. If it evaluates to true, the loop statements execute. If it evaluates to false, the execution of the loop ends.

### increment — it updates the loop counter with a new value each time the loop runs.

## The While Loop
### The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

### Syntax
#### while (condition) {
 #### // code block to be executed
#### }

## The do...while Loop
### The do-while loop is a variant of the while loop, which evaluates the condition at the end of each loop iteration. With a do-while loop the block of code executed once, and then the condition is evaluated, if the condition is true, the statement is repeated as long as the specified condition evaluated to is true. The generic syntax of the do-while loop is:

#### do {
  ####  // Code to be executed
#### }
#### while(condition);
