# Call stack

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.
Example
function greeting() {
   // [1] Some code here
   sayHi();
   // [2] Some code here
}
function sayHi() {
   return "Hi!";
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some code here
The code above would be executed like this:

Ignore all functions, until it reaches the greeting() function invocation.
Add the greeting() function to the call stack list.
Call stack list:

- greeting

Execute all lines of code inside the greeting() function.
Get to the sayHi() function invocation.
Add the sayHi() function to the call stack list.
Call stack list:

- sayHi
- greeting

Execute all lines of code inside the sayHi() function, until reaches its end.
Return execution to the line that invoked sayHi() and continue executing the rest of the greeting() function.
Delete the sayHi() function from our call stack list.
Call stack list:

- greeting

When everything inside the greeting() function has been executed, return to its invoking line to continue executing the rest of the JS code.
Delete the greeting() function from the call stack list.
Call stack list:
EMPTY

In summary, then, we start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.

## The JavaScript Call Stack - What It Is and Why It's Necessary

The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.

This article is aimed at explaining what the call stack is and why it is needed. An understanding of the call stack will give clarity to how “function hierarchy and execution order” works in the JavaScript engine.

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

The understanding of the call stack is vital to Asynchronous programming (which we will look at in a later article).

In Asynchronous JavaScript, we have a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.

But before we jump the gun, let us first attempt to answer the question - What is the call stack?

At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

Let’s break down our definition:

LIFO: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

Let us take a look at a code sample to demonstrate LIFO by printing a stack trace error to the console.

function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
When the code is run, we get an error. A stack is printed showing how the functions are stack on top each other. Take a look at the diagram.

Stack trace error
You will notice that the arrangement of the functions as a stack begins with the firstFunction() (which is the last function that got into the stack, and is popped out to throw the error), followed by the secondFunction(), and then the thirdFunction() (which is the first function that gets pushed into the stack when the code is executed).

Temporarily store: When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. This stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.

## JavaScript error messages && debugging


Most of your time as a developer is spent reading code followed by debugging that same code, most likely to be able to read it or solve an “unexpected feature” (which, joking aside, is more correctly known as a “bug”).

This is a sample of an error, the green is the overall error message, the light blue is to note if the error was properly handled, the brownish (dark yellow) is the type of error and the red is the call stack
The code that was run was the following (this is code for example purposes):
(function testing(){
  var obj = {
    add
  }
  function add(a, b) {
    var result = a + b
    return result.split('')
  }
  var stringResult = obj.add("1", "2")
  var result = obj.add(1, 2)
})()
I will come back to this code in the call stack section, let us first see what the types of error can be.
Types of error messages
The first thing that indicates you that something is wrong with your code is the (in)famous error message that the one we saw just moments ago, it usually appears on your console (being developer tools of the browser, terminal or whatever else you are using).
For those already used to programming, reading an error message is like second nature, for everybody else, is something you learn either you like it or not so might as well talk a bit about each of them.
Reference errors
This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
console.log(foo) // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined
This is also a common thing when using const and let, they are hoisted like var and function but there is a time between the hoisting and being declared so when you try to access them a reference error occurs, the fact that this happens to let and const is called Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).
foo = 'Hello' // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined
let foo
Whatever you are using (var, let or const) the fix is as simple has declaring the variable before any declaration is made.
let foo;
foo = 'Hello'
Syntax errors
I know it’s in the name of the errors, but like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.
JSON.parse( {'foo': 'bar'} ) // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1
This can be solved by just fixing the syntax, in this case the object should be a JSON.
JSON.parse('{"foo":"bar"}')
Some syntax errors like sending a trailing comma when calling a function are handled without error by most recent browsers, but older ones you have to be careful.
Range errors
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.
var foo= []
foo.length = foo.length -1 // Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length
An array for instance cannot have a negative length, why would you mess with the array length? Some people use it to set an array to empty, something of the likes of:
var foo = [0, 0]
foo.length = foo.length - 2 // (or foo.length - foo.length)
foo // would log [] instead of [0, 0]
I prefer not to mutate my variables whenever possible (making them constants and not variables) but this is a method that is available and now you know it.
Type errors
Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
var foo = {}
foo.bar // undefined
foo.bar.baz // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'baz' of undefined
This is probably the most frequent error in JS, trying to access a property/method thinking that bar is of the type object when in reality, since it hasn’t been declared yet, it’s undefined which doesn’t have any baz available.
The fix is simple, just make sure that bar exists before trying to access it, either by creating bar or by checking for undefined.
var foo = { bar: {} }
foo.bar.baz // undefined but you avoid the error
or
var foo = {}
if (typeof foo.bar !== 'undefined') {
  foo.bar.baz // this will never be executed while bar does not exist
}
There are also warnings, for instance telling you about a deprecated method, which can be found more frequently in firefox developer tools.

Debugging

To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (F5).
If the line you selected was run you will be able to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting what you are expecting.
The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

You can also add conditional breakpoints by right-clicking a previous set breakpoint, which will make your program stop at that point only if a condition is met, this is awesome for when you want to debug huge cycles for specific values. In this example the breakpoint will point stop when the index reaches 40.
Using Node.js with Visual Studio Code you can press the debug tab and add a configuration similar to this:

The program should be the file you have as an entry point for your application
You can run the debugger by pressing F5 or pressing the green play button.
Call stack
The red part of our first example represents the call stack, which is the path that your program has taken to reach the point were you set a breaking point or were you have an error.
Taking into account the example we saw earlier:
(function testing(){
  var obj = {
    add
  }
  function add(a, b) {
    var result = a + b
    return result.split('')
  }
  var stringResult = obj.add("1", "2") // stringResult becomes "12"
  var numberResult = obj.add(1, 2) // numberResult is never set, an error is thrown
})()
Let’s see this example in order:
testing is automatically called since it’s an IIFE (immediately Invoked Function Expression);
obj variable is declared with the function add (using ES6 shorthand for functions in objects, it would be the same having var obj = { add: add } ;
the function add is called from the obj variable with two strings has parameters, there are added which makes them “12” in this scenario and then split is called before returning [“1”, “2”];
the function add is called again, this time with number, the values are added making it 3 but then, split (which is not available for number type variables) is called which makes an error being thrown;
This decomposition is easy enough when you are more than used to seeing code but for someone starting out it could probably be a challenge (not wanting to underestimate people that are starting but I believe is preferable a more obvious example than a more convoluted one).
Paired with breakpoints it is easier to create a code execution in scenarios like this by taking into account the call stack which is available, for example, in chrome developer tools “sources” tab.
