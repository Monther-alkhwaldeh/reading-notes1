# Domain Modeling

## Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model

### A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

### Model epic fails videos

### Imagine you've been tasked to build a program that models the popularity of epic fail videos. After months of painstaking research, you've determined that the two essential metrics for gauging popularity are an epic rating and whether or not the video has animals.

### Since you'll be modeling the popularity of many types of videos—parkour epic fails, corgi epic fails, etc.—you'll want to build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors. That way, when you need to change the algorithm for determining popularity, the changes will be small and targeted.

### As you read this article, type out and run all code samples you come across. Do not copy and paste. Writing out and testing your code will help you remember how to implement domain models in JavaScript later.

### Define a constructor and initialize properties To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function. Below is a table that summarizes a JavaScript representation of an EpicFailVideo object.

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

## WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

### Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model

### of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,

### variables and functions take on new names.

### IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME

### KNOWN AS PROPERTIES

### If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property. Properties te ll us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has. Each individual hotel might have a different name and a different number of rooms @ FUNCTIONS, METHODS & OBJECTS IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object. For example, you can check how many rooms are available by subtracting the number of booked rooms from the total number of rooms

## html table

## There are several types of information that need to be displayed in a grid or table. For example: sports results, stock reports, train timetables

### When representing information in a table, you need to think

### in terms of a grid made up of rows and columns (a bit like a

### spreadsheet). In this chapter you will learn how to

### Use the four key elements for creating tables 

### Represent complex data using tables

### Add captions to tables
