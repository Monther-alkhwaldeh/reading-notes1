##  HTML
### We will spend the first chapter looking at how HTML is used tocreate web pages. You will see that you start by writing down the words you want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the words sothat the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph begins and ends, and so on.

## CSS:
### We start this section with a chapter that explains how CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling ### and layout of web pages.

### Properties generally fall into one of two categories:
### Presentation:
 ### How to control things like the color of text, the fonts you want to use and the size of those fonts, how ### to add background colors to pages (or parts of a page), and how to add background images.
### Layout:
### How to control where the different elements are positioned on the screen. You will also learn several techniques that professionals use to make their pages more attractive.

### Practical:
### We end up with some helpful information that will assist you in building better websites.

# HTML5 Layout:
## HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

### They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find it easier to understand how they can be used now that you have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. 
### These new elements are going to play an important part in creating
### layouts going forward. In this chapter you will see:

### -The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
### - How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
### - How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements
 ### As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still subject to change but it is already widely being used by web developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.
